1. Introduction
===============

This template is based on the software specification used by Canonical for its
Ubuntu Linux Distribution. This file is meant to be used as a guide for
creating a software specification (requirements and implementation) prior to
development of a project.

When building massive machines, or a huge civil works project, planning is
vital to the success of the project. Whether physical or digital, it is
important to think about the problem and the solution and design an approach
that efficiently solves it using effective design. Doing so will reduce the
time and costs involved to solve the problem and allow a company or
organization to quickly move to the next problem.

Another important aspect of having the software specification laid out is that
all parties involved in the development of the project will have a written
agreement on how to solve a problem. This allows team members to quickly and
effectively achieve their goals for the project with minimal lost time. It also
allows everyone involved to evolve and agree on an implementation strategy for
all aspects of the project. Having a written specification will also increase
community interest in your project.

This template makes it easier to going on writing a specification for your
software project to increase community interest in your project.

A specification should be written with the following considerations:

* The person implementing it may not be the person writing it. It should be clear
enough for someone to be able to read it and have a clear path towards
implementing it. If it doesn't, it needs more detail.

* That the use cases covered in the specification should be practical situations,
not contrived issues.

* Limitations and issues discovered during the creation of a specification should
be clearly pointed out so that they can be dealt with explicitly.

* If you don't know enough to be able to competently write a spec, you should
either get help or research the problem further. Avoid spending time making up
a solution: base yourself on your peers' opinions and prior work.

* Specifications should be written in clear, concise and correct English. If
you're not a native speaker, co-editing the spec with somebody who is might be
a good idea.

2. Rationale
============

This section should be a description of why your project is being developed.
What problem does it solve, and possibly, why other solutions are inadequate.

The rationale section should be a mission statement for your project. What do
you hope the project will accomplish when the final defined feature has been
implemented?

Sometimes when trying to write a rationale, the feelings of the project when
trying to express them in writing just doesn't feel right, or you are having
trouble defining exactly what your project hopes to accomplish. This probably
means that your are not exactly clear on what the problem is.

3. Use Cases
============

Use cases are positive statements which (loosely) conform to a pattern like

* A person and their role
* The objective they want to achieve
* The steps they go through
* The positive result

Specifically, describing the current unsatisfactory state of affairs is not a
use case; that belongs in the Rationale section.

4. Implementation
=================

This section is usually broken down into subsections, such as user interface
requirements and pictures (photographs of drawings on paper work well).

To implement a specification, the assignee should observe the use cases
carefully, and follow the design specified. He should make note of places in
which he has strayed from the design section, adding rationale describing why
this happened. This is important so that next iterations of the specification
(and new specifications that touch upon this subject) can use the specification
as a reference.

5. Summary
==========

The summary should not attempt to say why the spec is being defined, just what
is being specified.

6. Outstanding Issues
=====================

Use this section to document issues found while writing the specification, or
issues found while implementing the specification.

7. Specification Examples
